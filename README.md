# MassHide
In D&D (3E+), we know more Spotters have a better chance to detect more Hiders. 
But exactly how much more? Here's a simulator to find out.

This program was written and used to answer questions in the 
Wandering DMs talk show Season 02, Episode 49: "Dice Mechanics" (12/06/20).
See: https://youtu.be/X5wF8p1K8pU

Sample result: With 4 Hiders and 4 Spotters, and equal skill bonuses on each side,
the chance for the sneakers to be discovered is: close to 99%!
